# CNC Plotter using ATMEGA328

This is a multi-purpose CNC-plotter that made using Arduino nano(at mega 328) as the main controller. Using ***Ink space***, we can create the gcodes of any image and using a ***Processing*** application called  ***gcode executer***, we can feed the g-code values to CNC-plotter.
